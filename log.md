# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've done the two first exercises of the C++ path in exercism.

**Thoughts**: I've register in the plataform exercism to start to do some active learning, 
working in real code situation. I've done the two first exercises of the path.
I was a litlle bit confussing about how exercism works, so i late in set-up all
things, still here are the two first exercises, one of write a hello world function
and the other write a Hamming distance function ([Hamming distance article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)).

### Day 2: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I modify the Hamming distance exercise for took as an argument
a char pointer instead of string type and I've try to do other exercise of exercism.

**Thoughts**: I've try to do a the count of the nucleotides of DNA problem, I have a 
complication with the implementation, in exercism when you dowmload a problem there are
two files the first with extension .cpp and other with .h, in the tutorial that I have 
been reading [Quick C++ tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_quick_guide.htm)
there is not a explication of the .h files, so I've to research how to use that .h files and 
about the std library of C++.
