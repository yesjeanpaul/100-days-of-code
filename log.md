**Today's Progress**: I've done the two first exercises of the C++ path in exercism.

**Thoughts**: I've register in the plataform exercism to start to do some active learning, 
working in real code situation. I've done the two first exercises of the path.
I was a litlle bit confussing about how exercism works, so i late in set-up all
things, still here are the two first exercises, one of write a hello world function
and the other write a Hamming distance function ([Hamming distance article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)).
