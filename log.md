# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've done the two first exercises of the C++ path in exercism.

**Thoughts**: I've register in the plataform exercism to start to do some active learning, 
working in real code situation. I've done the two first exercises of the path.
I was a litlle bit confussing about how exercism works, so i late in set-up all
things, still here are the two first exercises, one of write a hello world function
and the other write a Hamming distance function ([Hamming distance article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)).

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 1](Code/day1.md)

### Day 2: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I modify the Hamming distance exercise for took as an argument
a char pointer instead of string type and I've try to do other exercise of exercism.

**Thoughts**: I've try to do a the count of the nucleotides of DNA problem, I have a 
complication with the implementation, in exercism when you dowmload a problem there are
two files the first with extension .cpp and other with .h, in the tutorial that I have 
been reading [Quick C++ tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_quick_guide.htm)
there is not a explication of the .h files, so I've to research how to use that .h files and 
about the std library of C++.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 2](Code/day2.md)

### Day 3: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I end the nucleotide count problem.

**Thoughts**: This problem took me so much time becouse the test for the code have a lot
of problems with the const type that the testing request, after I finally understood how
to use the header files. I've asking about what the sections #if !defined(NUCLEOTIDE_COUNT_H)
are, it seems that is something called macros, I'm gonna investigate what is that.

### Day 4: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solve the grade school exercise

**Thoughts**: It give me some problems to do this exercise, becouse I change of pc and take me
so much time to find out how to compile and run the test, finally can run the tests, and finally 
take me a lot of time understand the syntax of the data structures, it seems that I have to read more about std library. And I discover that in C++ you cannot have a variable and function with the same name.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 4](Code/day4.md)

### Day 5: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read the first chapter of competitive programming 3 the new lower bound of programming contests.

**Thoughts**: With the first chapter of this book I think that do well
in this contest is not impossible but it requires so much discipline and constant practice, all the time I heard about this type of contest 
I think about as something of being a genious but it's most likely to be a athlete you have to work everyday to get better results.

### Day 6: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Upgrade the grade school exercise

**Thoughts**: When I finish the grade school exercise I feel that I can
get better with the add function so I came with other way to do it, but 
with two differents codes one do it in a long way and the other using a fancy function to do it.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 6](Code/day6.md)

### Day 7: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Make RNA transcription exercise

**Thoughts**: I understand why a lot of people don't like C++, for each basic type of data
you have various derivates types, I explain more, you don't have only char type, you have
const char type, char& type, char* type, char[ ] type, char* [ ] type and const char[ ] type (not sure), 
that makes so difficult to work with and I left to mention the string or std::string type that 
underneath the hood is a variation of char [ ] type, this make me lost a lot of time becouse 
I feel the type system of C++ is more complicated than C for that kind of variations.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 7](Code/day7.md)

### Day 8: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Make two fer exercise of exercism and two problems of code wars

**Thoughts**: I feel more confident about my knowledge in C++ but I feel
I need to formalize that what I learn, not only understand how but why I do that.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 8](Code/day8.md)

### Day 9: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I make two problems in the UVa judge online problems

**Thoughts**: I've been reading about competitive programming so I 
have to try with some exercises, becouse I'm learning C++ at the time
that I enter in this world I started with the super easy to get clear
the I/O data processing to go for more complicated stuff.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 9](Code/day9.md)

### Day 10: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I make one problem of UVa judge and try another

**Thoughts**: I already do the super-easy sugested problems of the introduction
of the comptetive programming 3 book, I try one of the easy ones but it takes me 
time to understand the problem, so I try tomorrow. I feel that doing this 
stuff makes me better developer trying to solve this problems in the most eficcient
way.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 10](Code/day10.md)

### Day 11: February 28, 2020

### Day 22: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I do the questions of the introduction chapter
of the competitive programming book.

**Thoughts**: do this questions makes me feel that I don't know nothing about
algorithms I studied algorithms and data structures a long time ago, but I think
this book have more topics that I've studied. 

### Day 22: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I do the questions of the introduction chapter
of the competitive programming book.

**Thoughts**: do this questions makes me feel that I don't know nothing about

this book have more topics that I've studied. 

### Day 23: March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I do another exercise in UVa judge and read about 
C++.

**Thoughts**: I feel that reading fragments of the book C++ helped me to understand
this programming language and do some common mistakes that people that come from 
other languages background do, so I understand that I have to write code not like a
C-style (I learn this language first) instead C++-style.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 23](Code/day23.md)

### Day 24: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I read about linear data structures in the book of 
competitive programming.

structures is fundamental to solve any problem in CS.

### Day 25: March 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I try to do two exercises, one I have an idea
to solve it and the other is good but I have time excedeed so I have to 
optimize.

**Thoughts**: I was thinking that do many excersises and don't have problems
can't last forever, today I have my first time excedeed veredict, I have to 
optimize the code. I'm going to upload my first aproach to the problem, 
tomorrow I'll try to fix it.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 25](Code/day25.md)

### Day 26: March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continue to work in the same problem of
yesterday, I can't finish them yet.

**Thoughts**: I have to search the solution of the problem, becouse
I can't come with a solution, I think that I don't going to do that
again becouse it can be counterproductive to me, only I do it again
if is absolutely necessary, I think is a better approach of doing 
various exercises at the same time will be better, so I can change 
the problem when I get stucked.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 26](Code/day26.md)

### Day 27: March 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read about divide and conquer, working on 
problems of linear DS, the problem contest scoreboard.

**Thoughts**: Today I feel a little frustated with a problem, becouse
I think that C++, is no that powerfull to handle strings, but I found
a class so usefull to handle the console inputs called istringstream,
and finally I'm gonna learn frontend development on the weekends of the
challenge.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 27](Code/day27.md)

### Day 28: March 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read about divide conquer specifically I read about
maximum subarray problem, today I tried to end the exercise contest scoreboard.

**Thoughts**: Today I tried to end the problem that I was working yesterday,
still don't ended becouse my code was so buggy and messy so maybe I have to learn
more about C++ becouse I think I can do the problem but still my knowledge of C++
is so short and I can found the ways to do the things I'm thinking.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 28](Code/day28.md)

### Day 29: March 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I see how the competitive programer errichto
do his contests and almost done the problem of yesterday.

**Thoughts**: Today I made a better workflow I think that see errichto working
made me better becouse I try to do a super clean code and I was not using OPP
but when I see how he works inspired me to do a better code, and I almost end
the problem I was stucked.

### Day 72: May 9, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I made 4 exercises on the UVa judge easy section.

**Thoughts**: I made it very quickly, because I have already codes ready to submit,
a little tweaks and it was ready to submit, I think that I'm improved a lot in 
C++ since my very first day, in the firsts days it would take me so much time to 
do this exercises, I feel excited of the progess.
