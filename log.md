# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've done the two first exercises of the C++ path in exercism.

**Thoughts**: I've register in the plataform exercism to start to do some active learning, 
working in real code situation. I've done the two first exercises of the path.
I was a litlle bit confussing about how exercism works, so i late in set-up all
things, still here are the two first exercises, one of write a hello world function
and the other write a Hamming distance function ([Hamming distance article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)).

### Day 2: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I modify the Hamming distance exercise for took as an argument
a char pointer instead of string type and I've try to do other exercise of exercism.

**Thoughts**: I've try to do a the count of the nucleotides of DNA problem, I have a 
complication with the implementation, in exercism when you dowmload a problem there are
two files the first with extension .cpp and other with .h, in the tutorial that I have 
been reading [Quick C++ tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_quick_guide.htm)
there is not a explication of the .h files, so I've to research how to use that .h files and 
about the std library of C++.

### Day 3: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I end the nucleotide count problem.

**Thoughts**: This problem took me so much time becouse the test for the code have a lot
of problems with the const type that the testing request, after I finally understood how
to use the header files. I've asking about what the sections #if !defined(NUCLEOTIDE_COUNT_H)
are, it seems that is something called macros, I'm gonna investigate what is that.

### Day 4: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solve the grade school exercise

**Thoughts**: It give me some problems to do this exercise, becouse I change of pc and take me
so much time to find out how to compile and run the test, finally can run the tests, and finally 
take me a lot of time understand the syntax of the data structures, it seems that I have to read more about std library. And I discover that in C++ you cannot have a variable and function with the same name.

### Day 5: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read the first chapter of competitive programming 3 the new lower bound of programming contests.

**Thoughts**: With the first chapter of this book I think that do well
in this contest is not impossible but it requires so much discipline and constant practice, all the time I heard about this type of contest 
I think about as something of being a genious but it's most likely to be a athlete you have to work everyday to get better results.

### Day 6: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Upgrade the grade school exercise

**Thoughts**: When I finish the grade school exercise I feel that I can
get better with the add function so I came with other way to do it, but 
with two differents codes one do it in a long way and the other using a fancy function to do it.

### Day 7: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Make RNA transcription exercise

**Thoughts**: I understand why a lot of people don't like C++, for each basic type of data
you have various derivates types, I explain more, you don't have only char type, you have
const char type, char& type, char* type, char[ ] type, char* [ ] type and const char[ ] type (not sure), 
that makes so difficult to work with and I left to mention the string or std::string type that 
underneath the hood is a variation of char [ ] type, this make me lost a lot of time becouse 
I feel the type system of C++ is more complicated than C for that kind of variations.

### Day 8: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Make two fer exercise of exercism and two problems of code wars

**Thoughts**: I feel more confident about my knowledge in C++ but I feel
I need to formalize that what I learn, not only understand how but why I do that.

### Day 9: February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I make two problems in the UVa judge online problems

**Thoughts**: I've been reading about competitive programming so I 
have to try with some exercises, becouse I'm learning C++ at the time
that I enter in this world I started with the super easy to get clear
the I/O data processing to go for more complicated stuff.

### Day 10: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I make one problem of UVa judge and try another

**Thoughts**: I already do the super-easy sugested problems of the introduction
of the comptetive programming 3 book, I try one of the easy ones but it takes me 
time to understand the problem, so I try tomorrow. I feel that doing this 
stuff makes me better developer trying to solve this problems in the most eficcient
way.

### Day 11: February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I make one UVa judge problem

**Thoughts**: I just think that made that problem take me so much time for the
the difficulty it has.

### Day 12: February 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I attemp other UVa judge problem

**Thoughts**: I still thinking that it take me so long resolve so simple exercises
but I gonna find a way to accelerate the process.

### Day 13: March 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I made other UVa judge problem

**Thoughts**: The last few days I'm thinking on start a blog I'm gonna search the way
to start one, there are several options that I know Wordpress, jekyll, medium .. I'm gonna
think which one is good for me.
